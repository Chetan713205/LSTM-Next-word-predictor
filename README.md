### **Text Generation with LSTM**  
Implemented a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to predict the next word in a given text sequence. The project involves:  
- Preprocessing text data with a tokenizer for sequence generation.  
- Building an LSTM-based Sequential model with an Embedding layer for word vectorization.  
- Training the model on input text data and evaluating performance using categorical cross-entropy.  
- Creating a function for real-time next-word prediction.
